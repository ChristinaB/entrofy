Participant selection for workshops and conferences made easy.

We are implementing selection of participants for meetings as a discrete optimization problem.

More to come here as we hack on this!

## Overview

Given a list of participants with various "features" (e.g., gender, career stage, subfield, geography), the code will figure out the distribution of features and generate sublists that meet desired feature distributions (e.g, 50% male/female, 30% junior, 30% non-US). 

Features are user determined based on fields and values present in uploaded CSV file.

Input: CSV file
Output: stats of input list,
